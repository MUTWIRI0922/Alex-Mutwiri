    <p>
        I started my academic life in the year 2007 when i was 4 years old.
        My academic journey started in nursery class in a public primary school known as
        Kimbimbi primary school.The school is in Mwea East subcounty in Kirinyaga county.
        My primary school life was not soo much bad since there was no fees required apart from little exam fees.
    </p>
    <p>
        Academics were favourable to me and I did not struggle alot while learning. 
        I was really good in mathematics but average in other subjects. The teachers we had really
        pressured us to succeed. Through talking to us, through caning us when we misbehaved , and I must say it 
        truly worked well on us.    </p>
     <p>
         I completed my primary school education in the year 2015, and scored a total of 346 marks.

     <h1> Secondary school education </h1>
     <p>
         In January 2016, I got a full scholarship in a school known as Kings Group of Schools.
         The school was in kajiado county along the Kitengela-Isinya highway. It was a private school that majorly
         dealt with helping the less fortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
         I studied there until form two term two when the scholarship was terminated. i stayed at home for a whole
         month after which i joined another school known as Mutunguru Secondary School. It is in Meru county.
         That is where i completed my secondary ediucation in 2019 and scored a B+.
